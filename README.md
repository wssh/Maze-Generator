# Maze-Generator
A maze generator that was inspired by Daniel Shiffman's video from the Coding Train YouTube channel.
This maze generator runs on Java, visualized on Processing. It incorperates randomized depth-first search and backtracking using stack in order to generate the maze. Will be implementing several path finding algorithms(breadth first search, dikstra's, a*) on top of this maze to solve the mazes.


todo:

serialization of larger mazes (currently throws stack overflow if there are too many cells)

solve the maze using any algorithm, or more

make a game

make a UI where variables can be dynamically changed
